# Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data, making them an ideal choice for forecasting stock prices. The project allows users to compare predicted stock prices against the original stock prices, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Compare predicted prices with actual stock prices using clear and interactive plots.
- **Time-Series Modeling**: Utilize LSTM for accurate predictions.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building and training the LSTM model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.

## Usage
For demonstration, use the stock symbol [TATAMOTORS:NS](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TATAMOTORS:NSE?hl=en&window=MAX) to fetch sample stock data.

---

## Dataset Requirements
- The dataset should include at least the following columns:
  - Date
  - Open
  - High
  - Low
  - Close
  - Volume
- Ensure the data is cleaned and preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

---

## Results
The model outputs:
- Predicted vs. actual stock prices plotted over time.
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error) to assess model accuracy.

---

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating additional features such as technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
- Experimenting with other deep learning architectures like GRU or Transformer.
- Enhancing the visualization dashboard for better user experience.
